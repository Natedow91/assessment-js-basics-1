// In this section you will answer some work through problems 
//related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle 
    to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

// planning
// Analysis of requirments
// design
// implementation
// testing and intergration
// maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software 
    Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a 
    definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirments = "It is used to determine what the application is supposed to do and its reuirements. for example, is this social media? What resources do I need? is my team ready for this?"
const design = "The design will include a prototype and the main architecture of the application"
const implementation = "this is where a single programmer, pair or group of programmers get to write the code"
const testingAndIntergration = "it is very important that all the software gets tested before it is intergrated into the application or given to the public. once it has been tested it can be intergrated into the application"
const maintain = "Once the code is intergarted it will need to be maintained just in case something breaks it."
